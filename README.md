## Hi there! 👋

I'm Tranquil, a python developer who really enjoys coding. It's my favorite hobby!

### Where did you come from?

My mother, of course! But in actuallity, I'm a highschool student who has always been drawn to the wonders of computer science. It's rather unfortunate that AI is taking over now, but I won't let that discourage me.

### What kind of skills do you have?

I may not know too much, but I do know a few coding languages!

* ![Lua](https://github.com/Tranquil-M/Tranquil-M/blob/main/Lua.png?raw=true)
* ![Scratch???](https://github.com/Tranquil-M/Tranquil-M/blob/main/Scratch.png?raw=true)???

That's all! Take a look at some of my repositories, and have fun!
